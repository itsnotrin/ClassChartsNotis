# ClassChartsNotis

## Why:
I'm making this as my school recently moved over to a new system, classcharts and lots of people are having issues getting used to it. 
One of the main complaints is the lack of notifications- if you get a detention, homework etc, there is no longer a notification for it.
It won't be expandable at first, just while I work my way around learning the API, at one point I'll make it so there's a site, full signup system etc, but for now it'll just be made to work for one person and just get the job done.
